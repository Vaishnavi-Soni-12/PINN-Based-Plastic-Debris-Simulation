# data_validation/fetch

## Purpose

Documents and scaffolds manual dataset intake for offline validation.

## Scripts

- `fetch_grwl.py`
  - Placeholder loader for GRWL inputs.
- `fetch_hydrosheds.py`
  - Placeholder loader for HydroSHEDS inputs.

## Current Status

These scripts are intentionally lightweight and indicate where manual dataset download and path wiring should occur.

## Recommended Use

Use these as starting points when building an automated ingestion pipeline in the future.
